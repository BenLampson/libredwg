# LibreDWG C stream TDD target

This document defines the active C-side target for the DWG stream work. The
development target is libredwg C code, and the verification path is C blocking
read versus C stream read.

Scope correction: the active target is not ProtocolVNext and not any downstream
consumer. Stream TDD is developed and judged on the C side only. Every blocking
versus stream comparison in this phase means `dwg_read_file` in libredwg C
against `dwg_stream_file_ex` in libredwg C.

All stream TDD, parity checks, regression checks, smoke tests, and acceptance
reports for the current iteration use the C implementation on both sides of the
comparison. The blocking side is `dwg_read_file`; the stream side is
`dwg_stream_file_ex` and its C callbacks. Do not substitute a downstream
consumer, C# bridge, frontend path, or ProtocolVNext result for this C-to-C
comparison.

ProtocolVNext is not part of this target. Do not inspect, edit, build, or use
ProtocolVNext for stream TDD or validation unless the user explicitly changes
the scope.

Current iteration rule: all TDD and verification work stays in this repository.
Compare the C blocking reader against the C stream reader only:
`dwg_read_file` as the baseline and the C stream callbacks as the stream
candidate. `dwg_stream_file` remains the old object-only API, while
`dwg_stream_file_ex` carries decoded-object callbacks for strict stream parity.
This applies to stream TDD, regression checks, parity checks, large file smoke
tests, and acceptance reporting.

## 1. Hard objective

Build a real stream-oriented DWG read/decode path in libredwg.

The stream path must:

- Decode and emit enough DWG object, reference, and semantic content to match
  the C full-read baseline.
- Avoid calling `dwg_read_file` in the stream path.
- Preserve the old full-read path and old APIs.
- Match the `dwg_read_file` result for the test DWG before it is considered
  correct.
- Make memory reduction possible by not materializing the entire DWG object graph in native code.

Correctness comes first. Memory optimization is not accepted if the stream result diverges from the existing full-load result.

## 2. Non-goals

Do not solve this by:

- Modifying downstream repositories while this C-side target is active.
- Adding downstream layer-name heuristics before the C contract is fixed.
- Falling back to `dwg_read_file` inside the stream implementation.
- Overwriting the old DLL or old full-read shim.
- Using ProtocolVNext or frontend behavior as the primary validation path.
- Treating one specific layer as a special case.

If a stream result is wrong, the preferred fix is to expose the missing DWG semantics from libredwg.

## 3. Primary test file

Use this file as the first TDD fixture:

```text
E:\cadTestFolder\test1.dwg
```

Optional large-file validation set:

```text
C:\Users\benla\Desktop\CAD测试文件\最新5个大的
E:\项目额外大文件\CAD项目\CAD算量材料(1)\3F.00.dwg
```

The optional large files are useful for performance and memory checks, but they must not replace the strict parity test on `test1.dwg`.

## 4. Validation boundary

The current development and verification boundary is the C/libredwg side only.

The authoritative comparison is:

```text
dwg_read_file blocking C path  <->  dwg_stream_file_ex C stream path
```

Use `test/unit-testing/stream_test.c` as the TDD harness. The stream test should
compare C-observable data from the blocking baseline against C-observable data
from stream callbacks. Do not validate current stream work by running
ProtocolVNext, a C# shim, or a frontend endpoint unless explicitly requested
after the C side is stable.

## 5. TDD verification commands

After each C/libredwg stream change, build and run the C stream test.

```powershell
cd D:\Codes\libredwg

$env:PATH = "D:\Codes\libredwg\build-codex-stream-tdd;C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin;C:\msys64\usr\bin;$env:PATH"

cmake --build .\build-codex-stream-tdd --target stream_test

# With no fixture environment variables, `stream_test.exe` runs the default
# repository R13/R14/R2000/R2004/R2007 stream parity fixtures, plus TS1.dwg for
# OLE/OLE2 entity classification coverage. It also verifies that real
# R2010/R2013/R2018 fixtures reject `DWG_STREAM_F_NO_FULL_FALLBACK` without
# decoding objects or falling back to full load.

Remove-Item Env:LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_REFS -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
.\build-codex-stream-tdd\test\unit-testing\stream_test.exe

$env:LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_REFS = "1"

```

Use the large fixture as a smoke/performance guard, not as a replacement for
strict C parity on `test1.dwg`:

```powershell
Remove-Item Env:LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_DWG -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item Env:LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_REFS -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$env:LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_LARGE_DWG = "E:\项目额外大文件\CAD项目\CAD算量材料(1)\3F.00.dwg"
.\build-codex-stream-tdd\test\unit-testing\stream_test.exe
```

Optional decoded large-file smoke:

```powershell
$env:LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_LARGE_DECODED = "1"
.\build-codex-stream-tdd\test\unit-testing\stream_test.exe
```

## 6. Required pass criteria

The iteration is accepted only when C-side strict parity passes.

Smoke requirements:

- Stream metadata is present.
- Stream path reports `dwg_read_file` was not used (`full=0`).
- Stream object count is positive.
- Decoded stream object count matches the blocking baseline.
- Entity and non-entity counts match the blocking baseline.
- Handle mix and decoded handle mix match the blocking baseline.
- No native crash.
- Callback abort errors are propagated.
- Unsupported versions respect `DWG_STREAM_F_NO_FULL_FALLBACK`.

Strict C parity requirements against `dwg_read_file`:

- Object count must match.
- Entity and non-entity counts must match.
- Object handles and handle mix must match.
- Owner/layer reference snapshots must match when
  `LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_REFS=1`.
- `INSERT` / `MINSERT` block references and attribute counters must match.
- `DIMENSION_COMMON.block`, dimension style, and common dimension data must
  match.
- `BLOCK_HEADER` name/base/owned-entity snapshots must match.
- POLYLINE vertex ownership snapshots must match.
- Semantic hashes for common entities, color/ltype/material/plotstyle, text,
  insert, line, dimension, vertex, LWPOLYLINE, HATCH, and WIPEOUT must match.
- Semantic coverage counters for block headers, anonymous dimension blocks,
  INSERT/MINSERT, dimension block references, POLYLINE_3D vertices, HATCH,
  WIPEOUT, TEXT/MTEXT, ownerhandle/ownerless entities, model/paper/block-owned
  entities, and entmode buckets must match between the blocking and decoded
  stream paths.

The `stream_test.exe` output is the authoritative TDD result for the current
C-side target.

The harness also verifies callback combinations that downstream C consumers
depend on: legacy two-field `dwg_stream_file` callbacks, object-only streaming,
decoded-only `dwg_stream_file_ex` streaming, `dwg_stream_file_ex` full-fallback
decoded callbacks for unsupported stream versions when fallback is allowed,
callback abort propagation in both lightweight stream and full-fallback paths,
invalid public API arguments, and no-fallback unsupported version rejection
without object, decoded-object, or decode-error callbacks. It also verifies
that both old `dwg_stream_file` callbacks and `dwg_stream_file_ex` callbacks
can return `DWG_ERR_NOTYETSUPPORTED` as a callback abort once a stream path has
been selected, without being mistaken for an unsupported-version fallback
trigger. The old `dwg_stream_file` compatibility wrapper is also covered for
unsupported-version full fallback and `DWG_STREAM_F_NO_FULL_FALLBACK` flag
forwarding.

```

Repository fixture C parity is also covered by default:

```text

```

Extended local repository fixture sweep:

```text
R13/R14/R2000/R2004/R2007 root examples plus test/test-data/{2000,2004,2007}
LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_REPOSITORY_SWEEP=1: files=67 refs=0 passed
LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_REPOSITORY_SWEEP=1 LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_REFS=1: files=67 refs=1 passed
The refs=1 sweep also compares the semantic coverage counters listed above.
The repository sweep now hard-fails if its aggregate C-side coverage loses
block headers, block headers with owned entities, block entity chains,
anonymous dimension blocks, INSERT, dimension block references, POLYLINE_3D
vertices, HATCH, WIPEOUT, TEXT, MTEXT, ownerhandle/ownerless entities,
model/paper/block-owned entities, or entmode 0/1/2 buckets.
The default `stream_test` also creates a temporary R2000 MINSERT DWG through
the libredwg C add/write API and immediately verifies it through
`dwg_read_file` versus `dwg_stream_file_ex`, with `full=0`, `minserts=1`, and
`entmode3=1`.
Block-owned entities are classified by owner semantics, not by treating
`entmode=3` as the only block-owned case: an entity whose ownerhandle points to
a non-model/non-paper owner is counted as block-owned. Current local stream
fixtures cover block-owned entities through that C contract, and the generated
R2000 fixture covers the standalone `entmode=3` bucket.
Latest repository sweep semantic coverage:

block_headers=293 block_headers_owned=75 block_chains=293

```

Generated MINSERT C fixture parity:

```text
objects=38 decoded=38 r13=38 full=0 file_map=38
minserts=1 block_owned=3 entmode3=1
```

Default unsupported-version guard:

```text
example_2010.dwg, example_2013.dwg, and example_2018.dwg reject
DWG_STREAM_F_NO_FULL_FALLBACK with DWG_ERR_NOTYETSUPPORTED and no decoded
objects or decode-error callbacks.
```

Current stream hardening:

```text
R13/R2000 and R2007 handle-page stream readers validate that the handle page
has room for the page-size field and trailing CRC before reading page contents.
R13/R2000, R2004, and R2007 stream handle readers also validate signed object
offset deltas before applying them to the cumulative object address, so
malformed handle maps cannot wrap the stream object address through unsigned
arithmetic.
Handle value accumulation is also protected against unsigned overflow. The
reader deliberately preserves the existing tolerant behavior for suspicious but
historically accepted `handleoff` values; treating those as hard skips broke
valid C parity on `example_2004.dwg`.
`dwg_stream_file_ex` distinguishes unsupported DWG versions from callback
errors raised inside an already-selected stream decoder. Full fallback is only
allowed when no C stream path was selected and no user stream callback was
called, so callback return values are not swallowed or reinterpreted as fallback
requests.
Decoded-object streaming uses an isolated temporary Dwg_Data wrapper with its
own single-object pool, object_ref vector, and object_map for each decoded
callback. The host Dwg_Data object pool, object_ref, HANDSEED, dirty_refs, and
object_map are not borrowed or mutated by decoded callback emission.
`stream_test` directly covers this host-state isolation and verifies that the
host object_ref, HANDSEED, dirty_refs, and object_map state is preserved after a
decode-error path.

## 8. C-side work items

The stream implementation needs to expose DWG semantics that are currently only reliable in the full-load path.

Required areas:

1. `dwg_stream_file_ex` or the equivalent stream API must emit enough decoded objects and references for C-side parity.
2. The stream path must expose valid references for:
   - `INSERT` / `MINSERT` block headers.
   - `DIMENSION_COMMON.block`.
   - Anonymous dimension blocks.
   - Block-owned entities.
   - POLYLINE vertices.
   - HATCH / fill / wipeout / text entities.
3. Owner semantics must be correct:
   - Model-owned entity.
   - Block-owned entity.
   - Ownerless entity.
   - Recovered owner.
   - `entmode` behavior.
4. Block reference counting must be complete enough to decide which block contents should be replayed.
5. Referenced `BLOCK_HEADER` data must be available without a full `dwg_read_file`.
6. Text/style/layer/color resolution from stream must match full load.
7. POLYLINE_3D vertex ownership must be deterministic. A downstream pending-vertex fallback is not a proper final fix.
8. The stream API should let future consumers cache and replay block contents deterministically without guessing by layer name.

If the C API cannot provide one of these pieces yet, the missing contract should be documented explicitly before any downstream workaround is added.

## 9. Memory target

The native stream implementation should not allocate the same full DWG object graph as `dwg_read_file`.

Acceptance is staged:

1. First pass C strict parity on `E:\cadTestFolder\test1.dwg`.
2. Then validate that native stream avoids `dwg_read_file`.
3. Then measure peak memory on the large-file set.

The old observed problem is that some DWGs required tens of GB in the full-load path. The stream design is only useful if the native side provides an API that can be consumed incrementally later.

Downstream code may still aggregate data later for parity/debug reports. That is
outside the current validation loop, and the C/libredwg stream API must not
force full materialization.

## 10. Required iteration artifacts

Each development iteration should report:

- libredwg branch and commit hash.
- Build target and command.
- `stream_test.exe` output for `test1.dwg`.
- `stream_test.exe` output with `LIBREDWG_STREAM_TEST_REFS=1`.
- Large-file smoke output, if run.
- Whether the stream path used `dwg_read_file`.
- Summary of changed stream APIs or structs.
- Pass/fail result for every required criterion.
- Peak memory, if measured.

Do not treat an iteration as successful just because a downstream viewer opens a
file. The authoritative result for this phase is C strict parity plus no
`dwg_read_file` in the stream path.
